ToxiGuard is an extension that manipulates text to replace malicious words. ToxiGuard replaces offensive or harmful words with neutral or meaningful text in real time. ToxiGuard appears to be the first alternative strategy that can be integrated into various services to improve our interaction with the Internet. ToxiGuard stands out from existing systems that only support a few platforms or are designed solely to detect malicious content in that it works with any browser that supports the use of external extensions and works with any website accessed through a search engine.
